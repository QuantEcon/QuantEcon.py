def rng_integers(gen, low, high=None, size=None, dtype='int64',
                 endpoint=False):
    """
    Return random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive), or if
    endpoint=True, low (inclusive) to high (inclusive). Replaces
    `RandomState.randint` (with endpoint=False) and
    `RandomState.random_integers` (with endpoint=True).

    Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of the
    specified dtype. If high is None (the default), then results are from
    0 to low.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gen : {None, np.random.RandomState, np.random.Generator}
        Random number generator. If None, then the np.random.RandomState
        singleton is used.
    low : int or array-like of ints
        Lowest (signed) integers to be drawn from the distribution (unless
        high=None, in which case this parameter is 0 and this value is used
        for high).
    high : int or array-like of ints
        If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from
        the distribution (see above for behavior if high=None). If array-like,
        must contain integer values.
    size : array-like of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., (m, n, k), then m * n * k
        samples are drawn. Default is None, in which case a single value is
        returned.
    dtype : {str, dtype}, optional
        Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their name,
        i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder is not available and a specific
        precision may have different C types depending on the platform.
        The default value is 'int64'.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, sample from the interval [low, high] instead of the default
        [low, high) Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    out: int or ndarray of ints
        size-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate distribution,
        or a single such random int if size not provided.

# Random States

def check_random_state(seed):
    """
    Turn `seed` into a `np.random.RandomState` instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : None, int, `np.random.RandomState`, or `np.random.Generator`
        If None, the `np.random.RandomState` singleton is returned. If
        `seed` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance seeded with
        `seed` is returned. If `seed` is already a `RandomState` or
        `Generator` instance, then that instance is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    `np.random.RandomState` or `np.random.Generator`
        Random number generator.

    -----
