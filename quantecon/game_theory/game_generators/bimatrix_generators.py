"""
This module contains functions that generate NormalFormGame instances of
the 2-player games studied by Fearnley, Igwe, and Savani (2015):

* Colonel Blotto Games (`blotto_game`): A non-zero sum extension of the
  Blotto game as studied by Hortala-Vallve and Llorente-Saguer (2012),
  where opposing parties have asymmetric and heterogeneous battlefield
  valuations.

* Ranking Games (`ranking_game`): In these games, as studied by Goldberg
  et al. (2013), each player chooses an effort level associated with a
  cost and a score. The players are ranked according to their scores,
  and the player with the higher score wins the prize. Each player's
  payoff is given by the value of the prize minus the cost of the
  effort.

* SGC Games (`sgc_game`): These games were introduced by Sandholm,
  Gilpin, and Conitzer (2005) as a worst case scenario for support
  enumeration as it has a unique equilibrium where each player uses half
  of his actions in his support.

* Tournament Games (`tournament_game`): These games are constructed by
  Anbalagan et al. (2013) as games that do not have interim epsilon-Nash
  equilibria with constant cardinality supports for epsilon smaller than
  a certain threshold.

* Unit Vector Games (`unit_vector_game`): These games are games where
  the payoff matrix of one player consists of unit (column) vectors,
  used by Savani and von Stengel (2016) to construct instances that are
  hard, in terms of computational complexity, both for the Lemke-Howson
  and support enumeration algorithms.

    """
    Return a NormalFormGame instance of a 2-player non-zero sum Colonel
    Blotto game (Hortala-Vallve and Llorente-Saguer, 2012), where the
    players have an equal number `t` of troops to assign to `h` hills
    (so that the number of actions for each player is equal to
    (t+h-1) choose (h-1) = (t+h-1)!/(t!*(h-1)!)). Each player has a
    value for each hill that he receives if he assigns strictly more
    troops to the hill than his opponent (ties are broken uniformly at
    random), where the values are drawn from a multivariate normal
    distribution with covariance `rho`. Each playerâ€™s payoff is the sum
    of the values of the hills won by that player.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h : scalar(int)
        Number of hills.
    t : scalar(int)
        Number of troops.
    rho : scalar(float)

    mu : scalar(float), optional(default=0)

    random_state : int or np.random.RandomState, optional
        Random seed (integer) or np.random.RandomState instance to set
        the initial state of the random number generator for

    """
    Return a NormalFormGame instance of the 2-player game "unit vector
    game" (Savani and von Stengel, 2016). Payoffs for player 1 are
    chosen randomly from the [0, 1) range. For player 0, each column
    contains exactly one 1 payoff and the rest is 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : scalar(int)
        Number of actions.
    avoid_pure_nash : bool, optional(default=False)
        If True, player 0's payoffs will be placed in order to avoid
        pure Nash equilibria. (If necessary, the payoffs for player 1
        are redrawn so as not to have a dominant action.)
    random_state : int or np.random.RandomState, optional
        Random seed (integer) or np.random.RandomState instance to set
        the initial state of the random number generator for
        reproducibility. If None, a randomly initialized RandomState is
        used.
