Tools for working with games in Polymatrix form.

In a Polymatrix Game, the payoff to a player is the sum
of their payoffs from bimatrix games against each player.
i.e. If two opponents deviate, the change in payoff
is the sum of the changes in payoff of each deviation.

Examples
--------

Turn a Matching Pennies Normal Form Game into a Polymatrix Game.

>>> matching_pennies_bimatrix = [
... [(1, -1), (-1, 1)], [(-1, 1), (1, -1)]]
>>> nfg = NormalFormGame(matching_pennies_bimatrix)
>>> polymg = PolymatrixGame.from_nf(nfg)
>>> print(polymg)
2-player PolymatrixGame with payoff matrices:
(0, 1):
[[ 1. -1.]
 [-1.  1.]]
<BLANKLINE>
(1, 0):
[[-1.  1.]
 [ 1. -1.]]

(An example of a multiplayer game is not given because
then the polymatrix representation would not be unique and therefore
could not be reliably quoted for this doctest.)

    Head-to-head payoff components.

    hh stands for head-to-head.
    Calculates the payoffs to a player when they play
    an action with values at the actions of other players
    that try to sum to the payoff.
    Precise when the game can be represented with a polymatrix;
    otherwise, an approximation using least squares on the
    payoffs at every action combination.
    If an approximation, it may drastically change the
    game, use with caution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nfg : NormalFormGame
        The game.

    my_player_number : int
        The number of the player making the action.

    my_action_number : int
        The number of our player's action.

    is_polymatrix : bool, optional

        actually a polymatrix game. Defaults to True.

    Returns
    -------
