Functions for solving the income fluctuation problem. Iteration with either
the Coleman or Bellman operators from appropriate initial conditions leads to
convergence to the optimal consumption policy.  The income process is a finite
state Markov chain.  Note that the Coleman operator is the preferred method,
as it is almost always faster and more accurate.  The Bellman operator is only
provided for comparison.
