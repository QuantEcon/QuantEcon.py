## Major Changes

### Ver. 0.3.4 (23-February-2017)
1. Add support_enumeration, a simple algorithm that computes all mixed-action Nash equilibria of a non-degenerate 2-player game. See [PR #263](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/263)
2. Various fixes for issues with numba. See [PR #265](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/265), [PR #283](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/283)
3.Add lemke_howson algorithm to game_theory module. See [PR #268](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/268)
4. Add random game generators to game_theory module. See [PR #270](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/270)
5. Implement the imitation game algorithm by McLennan and Tourky. See [PR #273](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/273)
6. Add brute force for finding pure nash equilibria. See [PR #276](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/276)
7. Improve parameter names to QuantEcon.notebooks dependency fetcher. See [PR #279](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/279)
8. Utilities ``tic``, ``tac`` and ``toc`` moved to top level namespace of package. See [PR #280](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/280)

### Ver. 0.3.3 (21-July-2016)
1. Remove ``python2.7`` classifiers project only supports ``python3.5+``
2. Migrate ``sa_indices`` to be a utility function for the markov submodule
3. Updates ``probvec`` to include a multi-core parallel option using numba infrastructure in ``quantecon/random/utilities.py``

### Ver. 0.3.2 (25-April-2016)

1. Minor changes to ``NormalFormGame``. See [PR #226](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/226)
2. Update ``tauchen`` code to make use of Numba. See [PR #227](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/227)
3. Remove ``Python 2.7`` from test environment. Will support Python 3.5+
4. Updated ``qe.util.nb_fetch`` to not overwrite files by default
6. Remove ``num_actions`` from DiscreteDP. See [PR #236](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/236)
7. Add states/nodes to ``MarkovChain``/``DiGraph``. See [PR #237](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/237)
8. Updated ``DiscreteDP`` to include ``backward_induction`` (DiscreteDP now accepts beta=1). See [PR #244](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/244)
9. ``Numba`` is now a formal dependency. 
10. Modified ``tauchen`` to return a ``MarkovChain`` instance. See [PR #250](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/pull/250)

### Ver. 0.3.1 (22-January-2016)

1. Adds the ``quantecon/game_theory/`` sub package
2. Updates api for using ``distributions`` as a module ``qe.distributions``

### Ver. 0.3

1. Removes ``quantecon/models`` subpackage and the collection of code examples. Code has been migrated to the [QuantEcon.applications](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.applications) repository.
2. Adds a utility for fetching notebook dependencies from [QuantEcon.applications](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.applications) to support community contributed notebooks.
