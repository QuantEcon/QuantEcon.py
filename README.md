This repository collects code for quantitative economic modeling

Comprehensive documentation is currently being prepared

At present, the majority of the code is described at [quant-econ.net](http://quant-econ.net), in an on-line course authored by [Thomas J. Sargent](https://files.nyu.edu/ts43/public/) and [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net)

However this code repository is a separate project from [quant-econ.net](http://quant-econ.net), and we welcome contributions and pull requests

At present, the lead developers of this repository (in alphabetical order) are

* [Chase Coleman](https://github.com/cc7768)
* [Spencer Lyon](https://github.com/spencerlyon2)
* [Matthew McKay](https://github.com/sanguineturtle)
