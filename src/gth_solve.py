    r"""
    This routine computes the stationary distribution of an irreducible
    Markov transition matrix (stochastic matrix) or transition rate
    matrix (generator matrix) `A`.

    More generally, given a Metzler matrix (square matrix whose
    off-diagonal entries are all nonnegative) `A`, this routine solves
    for a nonzero solution `x` to `x (A - D) = 0`, where `D` is the
    diagonal matrix for which the rows of `A - D` sum to zero (i.e.,
    :math:`D_{ii} = \sum_j A_{ij}` for all :math:`i`). One (and only
    one, up to normalization) nonzero solution exists corresponding to
    each reccurent class of `A`, and in particular, if `A` is
    irreducible, there is a unique solution; when there are more than
    one solution, the routine returns the solution that contains in its
    support the first index `i` such that no path connects `i` to any
    index larger than `i`. The solution is normalized so that its 1-norm
    equals one. This routine implements the Grassmann-Taksar-Heyman
    (GTH) algorithm [1]_, a numerically stable variant of Gaussian
    elimination, where only the off-diagonal entries of `A` are used as
    the input data. For a nice exposition of the algorithm, see Stewart
    [2]_, Chapter 10.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like(float, ndim=2)
        Stochastic matrix or generator matrix. Must be of shape n x n.
    overwrite : bool, optional(default=False)
        Whether to overwrite `A`; may improve performance.

    Returns
    -------
    x : numpy.ndarray(float, ndim=1)
        Stationary distribution of `A`.
